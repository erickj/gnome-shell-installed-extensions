Notice To Packagers
-------------------

Please contact me before packaging this extension. 


Purpose:
--------

Make the top bar (panel) autohideable.


Installation:
-------------

Copy the tarball to $HOME/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
and unpack it.  A directory called autohidetopbar@fpmurphy.com
should be created.  For use by all users, install in
/usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions.
 
Restart your GNOME shell (Alt-F2 r is one way) and enable the
extension using:

     gnome-shell-extension-tool -e autohidetopbar@fpmurphy.com

To disable the extension:

     gnome-shell-extension-tool -d autohidetopbar@fpmurphy.com

Other tools such as gnome-tweak-tool, gsettings, dconf-editor,
etc. can also be used to enable or disable the extension.

If the extension does not install, check the version number in
metadate.json.  You may have to change it to work with your
particular version of the GNOME Shell. If this does not fix 
the problem, use Looking Glass (Alt-F2 lg) to see what the
error message is.


Version:
--------

V1.0   6/05/2011    Initial version for GNOME Shell 3.0

V2.0   11/1/2011    Initial version for GNOME Shell 3.2


Notes:
------

This version of the extension does NOT work on versions of
the GNOME Shell < 3.2.

This has only been tested on Fedora 16 and GNOME Shell 3.2.1.

As of the date of the latest version of this extension, there are
no officially published APIs for the GNOME Shell. This extension
relies on internal structures and variables which may or may
not be present in future versions of the GNOME Shell.

When enabled, you can double click on the top bar to toggle 
hiding on or off. Increase TIME_DELTA constant if double click 
does not work on your system.
